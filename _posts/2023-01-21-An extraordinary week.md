Bella, this is for you



<p>我是王佩豪，来自中国山西</p>
<p>I am Peihao Wang，from Shanxi, China </p>
<p>我认识了一个女孩，她的名字是bella</p>
<p>I met a girl whose name was Bella</p>
<p>她是英国伦敦人，在美国ASU读大学</p>
<p>She is a native of London, England, and attended university at ASU, USA</p>
<p>我最近了解了很多关于ASU的事情，这是一个很棒的大学</p>
<p>I've learned a lot about ASU lately, and it's a great university</p>
<p>我为你感到高兴，可以接受到很好的教育，这将是你未来一个很好的基础</p>
<p>I am happy for you and have a good education, which will be a good foundation for your future</p>
<p>但是我并不羡慕你，因为这是你应得的</p>
<p>But I don't envy you, because you deserve it</p>
<p>我没有上一个好的大学，这很大程度上是因为我高中没有好好学习</p>
<p>I didn't go to a good college, and it was largely because I didn't study well in high school</p>
<p>但这并不妨碍我拥有一个丰富的心灵</p>
<p>But this does not prevent me from having a rich heart</p>
<p>接下来，我会继续努力的，朝着我感兴趣的方向</p>
<p>Next, I will continue to work hard in the direction I am interested in</p>
<p>我猜你的学习应该很忙吧，在一天之内我几乎收不到你的消息</p>
<p>I guess your studies should be very busy, and I hardly hear from you in a day</p>
<p>我并不是在抱怨，这是一件好事，说明你足够专注，这是一个很好的习惯</p>
<p>I'm not complaining, it's a good thing, it shows that you're focused enough, it's an excellent habit</p>
<p>我唯一养成的好习惯大概就是锻炼</p>
<p>Probably the only good habit I've developed is exercise</p>



<p>我很高兴能够认识你，这也让我平凡的生活多了一点波澜</p>
<p>I'm glad to be able to meet you, which also makes my ordinary life a little more wavey</p>
<p>说实话，实习很无聊，但是认识你之后，总感觉，每天在期待着些什么</p>
<p>To be honest, internships are boring, but after getting to know you, I always feel like I'm looking forward to something every day</p>
<p>不要迟疑，就是在说你，你是我生命中的一道彩虹</p>
<p>Don't hesitate, it's saying that you, you are a rainbow in my life.</p>
<p></p>
<p>我看到ASU有一些在线学习项目，如果两个月之后的考试我能顺利通过，我会有一段很长时间的假期，我会考虑去学习一下</p>
<p>I see that ASU has some online learning programs, and if I can pass the exam in two months, I will have a long vacation, and I will consider studying for it</p>
<p>我在考虑之后要不要继续在这个岗位上继续工作，我觉得在这里我会丧失斗志，尽管做兼职可能不会特别稳定</p>
<p>After I considered whether to continue working in this position, I felt that I would lose my motivation here, although working part-time may not be particularly stable</p>
<p>我知道海外留学生也一定会很辛苦，和你们相比，我付出的努力实在微不足道</p>
<p>I know that overseas students must also work hard, and compared to you, my efforts are really insignificant.</p>
<p>今天是除夕，希望你能好一点，你们家应该也会过这个节日吧，真心祝愿你可以回到家里和家人团聚。</p>
<p>Today is Chinese New Year's Eve, I hope you can get better, your family should also celebrate this holiday, I sincerely hope that you can return home and reunite with your family.</p>
