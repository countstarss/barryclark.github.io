Record my life


<p>I didn't know what happened last night and always woke up in the middle of the night to drink water, which caused me to sleep poorly.I woke up in the morning to cook and made sweet and sour meatballs, unfortunately, the balls were a little spoiled, but I was still not willing to waste the ingredients, and I finished them.The food at noon was rice and meatballs, and due to my misjudgment, I used rhubarb rice, which caused the rice to be sticky.</p>
<p>Fortunately, today's work was very easy, I hardly did anything, it was really the most enjoyable day ever. I had a little diarrhea in the afternoon, but it wasn't very serious, just to empty my stomach, the pressure on my stomach during the Spring Festival was very high, even so, it was still much better than in previous years, and I knew that I would eat a lot as soon as I got home.I took the bus back home in the evening, bought some digestive medicines, ate instant noodles at night, added a ball, and it was quite delicious.This afternoon, I remembered another important matter, leaving the dormitory, so after I came back, I sorted out the materials and handed them to the student in charge of this matter, after all, it was 500 yuan, and I had to get what I deserved.</p>
<p>Then I thought about you, Bella, that our connection was always intermittent and I would love to talk to you about something meaningful.</p>
