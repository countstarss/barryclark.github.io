我心动了


<p>爱情的反讽之一在于：你越是不喜欢一个人，就越能够信心百倍、轻而易举地吸引他；强烈的欲望使人丧失了爱情中必不可少的漫不经心，你如果被人吸引，就会产生强烈的自卑情结</p>
<p>我发现一个问题，如果晚饭吃的太饱，人的意志力大概率会下降，很容易妥协，其实这个是昨天晚上发现的，昨天吃了3块饼，还喝了一大碗鸡汤，当然了，鸡汤当然不是我自己做的，是前几天我和
爸爸一块吃饭，打包回来的，我对自己的厨艺没有那么自信</p>
<p>-----</p>

<p>人即使是在一天当中，也会经历很多事情，如果不及时记下来，几天之后就会全部忘记，只留下一道浅浅的痕迹</p>
<p>今天你对我说过的那些话，我非常感动</p>
<p>你问我是不是要向你求婚？在那一瞬间，我心动了，我很喜欢你，但是我目前还没有办法承担起对你的责任，英国和中国的地理中心相距直线距离7779公里，距离可以最大限度消除我的羞怯，
同时也让承诺显得苍白又无力</p>
<p>在给你回复之前，我犹豫了很久，我想问你一个问题，你愿意做我的女朋友吗？</p>
<p>现在这个时代，节奏变得很快，很多人开始一段恋情是为了满足自己的需求，但是如果没有肉体的接触，他们的爱情还会那么纯粹吗？我是一个辩证的人，很多事物都在教会我们这个道理，
我相信，在某个阶段里，柏拉图式的爱情是纯粹的，精神的交流是令人愉悦的，但同时作为一个男人，我也有男人的本能，肉体接触是人的本能，也是爱情发展的必然阶段，我尊重自然。
  今天的话，说的很没有逻辑，希望你能懂我</p>
<p>之前受到爱情的打击时，绝大部分时间是单向的，总会感到绝望又无助，觉得我一定不会再相信爱情了，但是当你真正遇到对的人的时候，你会立刻沉溺进去</p>
<p>我认为，爱情中最浪漫的是分享欲，我每次看到些什么有趣的事情，都会分享给你，这意味着，它已经在萌芽了</p>
<p>当我事无巨细地给你分享我的生活，我发现我的生命原来也很丰富，我对经历过的事情有如此多的感想，并且我想都讲给你听。</p>
<p>如果有机会，我会去见你，如果我们一直有联系，我只是觉得自己不够好</p>
<p>中国人在说如果有机会这句话的时候，大概率只是一句客套话，但是我不想让我说过的话都只是一句客套话，我想让它变成一个目标</p>
<p>和朋友出去玩时，我会很准时，在我的印象里，我对人做出的承诺不多，我会尽量实现，不过直到现在，仍然有一件事情，一直萦绕在我的心头，我答应过我高中时的一个好朋友，会给她做一把
《刺客伍六七》里面主角的武器---魔刀千刃，当时花了很大心思去做这件事，但是难度有点大，而且非常考验手工，就没有完成，它像根刺一样扎在我的心里，所以没有十足的把握，我不会轻易承诺 ，以后，我会继续完成。</p>
<p>不知道你能不能看得懂中文，我想，问题应该不大，今天有一点晚了，明天或者后天有时间，我会把它翻译成英文给你看，希望你会看到我写的这些东西</p>




<p>I was moved</p>
<p>One of the ironies of love is that the more you dislike someone, the more confident and easy you can attract him; Strong desire makes people lose the indispensable carelessness in love, and if you are attracted to others, you will have a strong inferiority complex.
</p>
<p>I found a problem, if the dinner is too full, people's willpower will probably decline, it is easy to compromise, in fact, this was discovered last night, yesterday ate 3 cakes, and drank a large bowl of chicken soup, of course, chicken soup is of course not made by myself, it was a few days ago I ate with my father and packed back, I am not so confident in my cooking skills.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Even in the course of a day, people will experience many things, and if they are not written down in time, they will all be forgotten after a few days, leaving only a shallow trace.</p>
<p>I am very touched by what you said to me today.</p>
<p>You asked me if I was going to propose to you? At that moment, my heart was moved, I liked you, but I could not yet assume my responsibility to you, the geographical center of Britain and China is 7779 kilometers away in a straight line, and the distance can eliminate my shyness to the greatest extent, and at the same time make the commitment pale and weak.</p>
<p>I hesitated for a long time before replying to you, I want to ask you a question, would you like to be my girlfriend?</p>
<p>In this day and age, the pace has become fast, and many people start a relationship to meet their needs, but without physical contact, will their love still be so pure? I am a dialectical person, many things are teaching us this, I believe that at a certain stage, platonic love is pure, spiritual communication is pleasant, but at the same time as a man, I also have a man's instinct, physical contact is a human instinct, but also an inevitable stage in the development of love, I respect nature. Today's words are very illogical, I hope you can understand me.</p>
<p>When I was hit by love before, most of the time it was one-way, and I always felt hopeless and helpless, thinking that I would never believe in love anymore, but when you really met the right person, you would immediately indulge in it.</p>
<p>I think that the most romantic thing in love is the desire to share, and every time I see something interesting, I will share it with you, which means that it is already germinating.</p>
<p>When I share my life with you in every detail, I find that my life is also very rich, and I have so many feelings about what I have experienced, and I want to tell you all about it.</p>
<p>I'll go see you if I get the chance, and if we've been in touch, I just don't feel good enough.</p>
<p>Chinese is most likely just a polite remark when I say this sentence if I have the opportunity, but I don't want everything I say to be just a polite remark, I want it to become a goal.</p>
<p>When hanging out with friends, I will be very punctual, in my impression, I don't make many promises to people, I will try to achieve it, but until now, there is still one thing that has been haunting my heart, I promised a good friend from my high school that I would make her a weapon --- the magic knife thousand blades of the protagonist in "Assassin Wu Liuqi", and it took a lot of effort to do this at that time, but it was a little difficult, and it was very testing the handwork, so it was not completed, it was pierced in my heart like a thorn, so I was not completely sure , I will not easily promise , in the future, I will continue to finish.</p>
<p>I don't know if you can understand Chinese, I think, the problem should not be big, today is a little late, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow when I have time, I will translate it into English to show you, I hope you will see these things I wrote.</p>
