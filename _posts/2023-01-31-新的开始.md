A new beginning




<p>I haven't kept a diary for two or three days, and I'm ashamed of this weak self-control, in the end, it's still the lack of timing that makes a lot of time not time to do it, and at the same time, it consumes too much attention on entertainment, and I need to pay extra attention in the future.</p>
<p>Especially reading books today, I see a point of view that I agree with, wake up in the morning, our energy will return to the highest point, the first thing after waking up will guide the trend of the day, if you look at the mobile phone or other messages will fall into a vicious circle, resulting in the whole day without sufficient energy and positive attitude; If you wake up and prepare breakfast or do some exercise, you will most likely enter a positive cycle that will make it easier for you to start doing something positive or more challenging.</p>
<p>Today I was on my way back from the delivery, and I was thinking that it should be between 9 and 10 o'clock in the morning in the UK, and when you say hello, you usually say: good morning my love. I repeated "my love" a few times, and then I heard your message send me, and I set up a very classic QQ message tone for you</p>
<p>Two days ago, I found that my refrigerator was empty, so I bought some things, but I really can't buy too much, I eat alone, it is likely that it has not finished eating and has already become moldy and broken, fortunately, the two things thrown away before are not too expensive, otherwise I will really feel very distressed.</p>
<p>I officially started my exam preparation in February, I wish me success!</p>

<p>已经有两三天没有写日记了，我为这薄弱的自制力感到惭愧，说到底还是时间安排的不到位导致很多时间没有来得及去做，同时，在娱乐上面消耗了太多的注意力，以后要额外注意一下。</p>
<p>特别是今天看书，看到一个我很认同的观点，早上醒来，我们的精力会恢复到最高点，醒来后的第一件事会引导这一天的趋势，如果看手机或者其他消息会陷入到恶性循环中，导致一整天都没有充沛的精力和积极的态度；如果醒来之后去准备早饭或者做一些锻炼，你极有可能会进入一个正向的循环，让自己更容易开始做一些积极的或者更具挑战性的东西。</p>
<p>今天我去拿快递回来的路上，我在想现在应该是英国的上午九点钟到十点钟这段时间，你打招呼的时候一般会说：good morning my love. 我重复说了几遍“my love”,然后我就听到了你发给我消息，我为你设置了很经典的QQ消息提示音</p>
<p>前两天发现我的冰箱已经空了，于是又买了一些东西，不过真的不能买太多，我一个人吃饭，很可能还没有吃完就已经发霉坏掉了，还好之前扔掉的两样东西都不是太贵，不然我真的会很心疼。</p>
<p>从2月份我正式开始我的备考，祝我成功！</p>
