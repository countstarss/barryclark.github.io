<p>I had time to sit down and write something today. I woke up early this morning and went out for a bus ride after dinner, so I arrived early and didn't get in the same car as my colleague from yesterday, but today I brought her some buns that I had talked to her about before.</p>
<p>Today's work is a bit busier than all the previous ones, I had a lot of time to copy some verses or practise a bit of writing when I was at work before, but now I've reached a tacit agreement with another person to take care of some work each, and I've learnt to take time out of my busy schedule in the past two months or so, so I don't feel particularly dull.</p>
<p>I've just gone to wash up and am now applying a face mask and some cream to repair acne marks or redness on my face, not that I'm stinking of course, just normal maintenance of my skin, I wonder if any British men do that.</p>
<p>I look forward to my future self as a well-mannered, educated but understated person who looks frail but is actually a muscular man and is also good at sports. I've achieved at least part of that now, most people have an image of me as shy and uncommunicative, and yes, that was part of the plan.</p>
<p>Badminton is my home court, I love it, I have fun when I play and I have met a lot of good friends through it. I'm also working out, but the results are not particularly impressive, but I think it's enough at this stage.</p>
<p>I also watched a very interesting video today from Jonna Jinton, originally from www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsKWoCJ3eq4</p>
<p>Unfortunately, youtube is not available in China, as many foreign platforms do not fully comply with Chinese regulations, and probably won't be available in the future either. Take a look.</p>
<p>Lately, on my commute, I usually listen to an English channel that will put together some scenarios about English pronunciation, British culture and the use of some common sentences, it's been very beneficial and I really love this show.</p>
<p>Well, that's it for today, see you guys next time, that's a phrase I often hear at the end of the show.</p>


<p>今天有时间坐下来写一些东西了，今天早上起床比较早，吃完饭之后就出去坐车了，所以到的很早，没有和昨天的同事坐一辆车，不过今天给她带了几个之前和你说过的小面包。</p>
<p>今天的工作比之前的都要忙一些，之前上班时还有很多时间抄写一些诗句或者练一练字，不过现在我和另外一个人已经达成了默契，每人负责一些工作，我也在这两个多月的工作中学会了忙里偷闲，所以并不会感到特别枯燥。
刚刚去洗漱完，现在正敷着面膜，还用了一些用来修复脸上痘印或者红肿的面霜，当然了我并不是在臭美，只是正常的维护一下我的皮肤，不知道有没有英国男人会这样做呢。</p>
<p>我期待未来的自己是一个文质彬彬，有学识但很低调的人，看着文弱，实则肌肉型男，并且也很擅长运动。我现在至少已经达到了一部分，大多数人对我的印象都是腼腆，不爱说话，是的，这是计划的一部分，当然了我并不是有意要塑造这样的形象，而是很多时候，我并没有什么话想说。至于在场上，羽毛球野球场是我的主场，我很喜欢羽毛球，打球的时候我能享受到乐趣，并且野通过它认识了很多好朋友。我也有在健身，只不过效果不是特别特别显著，但是我认为现阶段来说已经足够了
今天还看了一个很有意义的视频，来自约娜·伊顿(Jonna Jinton)，原视频地址是www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsKWoCJ3eq4</p>
<p>很遗憾，中国并不能使用youtube，原因是国外很多平台并不能完全遵守中国的法规，可能以后也都不能用吧，youtube或者Facebook上的很多内容都过于开放和前卫，少接触一点也许利大于弊，我通过搬运号看到这个视频，他们负责转载并翻译视频内容，或许你也可以去看一看。
最近，在通勤的路上，我通常会听一个英语频道，它会将一些有关英语发音、英国文化还有一些常用句式的使用场景，受益良多，我真的很爱这档节目。</p>
<p>好了，今天就说到这里，see you guys next time，这是我在节目结尾经常会听到的一句话。</p>
